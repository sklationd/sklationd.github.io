# Hi, I hope you have a lovely day.

I'm a developer who's into running and meditation. I'm always up for learning new stuff and I'm super curious about how tech shapes our lives. My dream? A world where people can take good care of their mental health and live in tune with nature. And I want to be a part of making that happen.
